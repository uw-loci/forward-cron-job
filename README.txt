This cron job takes .tiffs generated by WiscScan and uploads them to the
UW-Forward database. It resides on the open.microscopy.wisc.edu machine.
Specifically, the workflow looks like this:

    1. Scientists gather data, check the "Share with Forward" checkbox in the
       metadata dialog box.
    2. This creates a METS companion file, which is copied to the users
       /data/username directory on open.microscopy.wisc.edu, along with the
       .ome.tiff files.
    3. The cron job contained in the file "publish" runs hourly. When it
       detects new files in the /data directory, it does two things:
       - Create a thumbnail for each dataset by running "CreateThumbnail.java"
       - Copy the thumbnail and the METS companion file into
         /var/www/forward/adds directory
    4. Forward queries the /var/www/forward/adds directory and links the files
       there to its website.

A couple of notes on setting this up properly. First, CreateThumbnail.java
needs to be compiled with loci_tools.jar (found here:
http://www.loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats). This file, along with /bftools
(also on that same website) and the log4j.properties file should all be stored
in the same directory as the publish script and CreateThumbnail.java.
CreateThumbnail.java can then be compiled by running:

    javac -cp loci_tools.jar CreateThumbnail.java

After that, the publish script (which calls the Java program) should run
correctly. To make it a cron job, it has been sym-linked to the
/etc/cron.hourly/ directory.
