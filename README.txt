This cron job takes image datasets produced by an acquisition system (such as
OME-TIFFs generated by WiscScan) and uploads them to the UW-Forward database.
It resides on the open.microscopy.wisc.edu machine.

Specifically, the workflow with respect to WiscScan looks like this:

    1. Scientists gather data, check the "Share with Forward" checkbox in the
       metadata dialog box.
    2. This creates a METS companion file, which is copied to the user's
       /data/username directory on open.microscopy.wisc.edu, along with the
       .ome.tiff files.
    3. The cron job contained in the file "publish.sh" runs hourly. When it
       detects new files in the /data directory, it does two things:
       - Create a thumbnail for each dataset by running "CreateThumbnail"
       - Copy the thumbnail and the METS companion file into
         /var/www/forward/adds directory
    4. Forward queries the /var/www/forward/adds directory and links the files
       there to its website.

To compile the code:
  mvn

To upload changes to the server:
  bin/upload-to-server.sh

After that, publish.sh (which calls the Java program) should run correctly. To
make it a cron job, it has been sym-linked to the /etc/cron.hourly directory.
